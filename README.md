# MUTICLASS-CLASSIFICATION-USING-SOFTMAX

This repository demonstrates how to implement a multiclass classification problem using the Softmax activation function. Softmax is commonly used in the output layer of a neural network for multi-class classification tasks, where it transforms raw model outputs (logits) into probabilities that sum to 1.

## Features

- Implement a simple neural network for multiclass classification using the Softmax activation function.
- Example dataset for multiclass classification.
- Preprocessing and model evaluation techniques for multiclass classification.

## Problem Overview

In multiclass classification, we aim to predict one of several possible categories (classes). Softmax is often used in the final layer of a neural network to handle the classification task, converting the networkâ€™s output into probabilities.

For this project, we demonstrate how to:

- Define a neural network with a Softmax output layer.
- Train the model on a sample dataset for multiclass classification.
- Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy and loss.
